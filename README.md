## Problem Statement
To create a WIN-WIN situation for customers and stores. Stores usually identifies the right customers for particular products, offers, and services which can be beneficial for customers. This translates into higher revenue and customer demand for stores. For this Clustering is needed. Clustering is the process of separating customers into groups based on certain traits or spending behaviors.

## My Approach
Creating Customer clusters to identify the different types of customers using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This is a clustering problem, So I utilising unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as KMeans Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.

## Technologies Used
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Sci-kit Learn

## Project Objectives
➣ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate & Bivariate analysis) and data report generation

➣ Data Preprocessing

➣ Model Building

➣ Clustering Application
